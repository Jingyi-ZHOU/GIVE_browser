      </p>
      <h2>2. Find LD SNPs</h2>
      <p>
        Find LD SNPs section is created for searching linked SNPs based on user
        specific SNPs or exsiting GWAS. Users can select linked SNPs by setting
        RÂ² and specific population.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Visualization</h2>
      <p>
        Visualization section provides interactive genome browser to view GWAS
        and LD SNPs. Moreover, genes, RDDAR, PhastCons data are also available
        in the visualization part.
